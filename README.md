# Akash Raj

🎓 Mechanical Engineering undergraduate at [National Institute of Technology, Patna](https://nitp.ac.in)  
🚀 Aspiring Software Engineer focused on web development, algorithms, and open-source contributions

I’m currently diving deep into computer science fundamentals, backend development, and practical software engineering through projects, open-source, and competitive programming. I'm preparing for opportunities like Google STEP, Meta Hacker Cup, SIH, and GSoC — aiming to solve real-world problems with clean, scalable code.

📚 Outside tech, I enjoy reading — currently on *Pride and Prejudice* by Jane Austen. Feel free to connect on [Goodreads](https://goodreads.com/akasr).
